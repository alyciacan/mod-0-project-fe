## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I liked the phrase the speaker used: "the myth of the brilliant developer", because I'd never heard this before and it's 100% how I thought of successful software devs. I realize now how unhelpful and negative that framing is. I was familiar with growth mindset but liked the tips she listed:
  a. You can always learn new things
  b. Track your __own__ progress, not others'
  c. Don't compare yourself to others
  d. Tomorrow will be better

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I already demonstrate a growth mindset with my kids. I am careful to encourage them to keep trying, and praise the effort not the result. I'm horrible at using a growth mindset with myself (this exact sentence, for example! Maybe I should say "I'm still working on using a growth mindset with myself"). I am proud of how far I've come and I have real evidence that I **can** learn- I need to remember that when things get hard.


3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
* It felt okay. I am proud of myself when I *don't* need these supports, and I have felt scaffolded enough that I was able to figure out the instructions without too much trouble.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement is used for decision-making. It sets a condition, or a sort of proposition (usually a comparison) that evaluates to true or false. Depending on the result, different actions may take place. A daily conditional might be: if I wake up on time, I will stop for a coffee on my way to work. If I wake up late, I won't. On the AirBNB website, users are given the option to put in dates for their trip, but it's not necessary to do so to see results. There is likely a conditional that *if* the user enters dates, then the search results will be filtered to only show properties that are available during the dates needed.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You can add multiple conditions that *both* need to be met by using &&, or *one of which* needs to be met by using ||. When using &&, the conditions will only be met if they both evaluate to true. If using ||, only one of them needs to evaluate to true for the condition to be met.


6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

I'm not sure exactly what this is asking, because I haven't seen any reference to specific tools. But what I would do is run the code with each conditional one by one to see if they are met. You can also just run the code as written with 2 conditionals, and if it evaluates to positive, the resulting actions will occur.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I just need more practice!
