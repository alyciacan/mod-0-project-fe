## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
It feels okay. It's a lot to remember, where to find things, when everything is new- Trello, Github, Terminal, etc. But it is scaffolded enough that I am making it happen.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Airbnb is one I use regularly- perhaps listings are stored as arrays. But also probably member IDs and certain options like how many guests there will be in a booking.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array is like a list- multiple values that are related in some way (same or different data types) and can be accessed by their indices.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop allows code to run multiple times without it having to be written over and over again. You can use a loop to examine each item in an array (like when you need to apply some function to items in a sequence) But you can also use loops without arrays, if you just need code to repeat itself.


5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
I would tell them that it's a plan with some steps in it, so you don't have to keep telling the computer to do the same things over and over again.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
The syntax for using a conditional in a loop is a little confusing to me. I've done them before in Python but they don't look as clean to me in JS.
